****************************************
Connecting a scheme to CCPP
****************************************

This chapter contains a brief description on how to add a :term:`scheme` to the :term:`CCPP Physics` pool. Aside from the basic design elements for interoperability (:term:`entry points <entry point>`, metadata files), most CCPP requirements simply follow from coding best practices.

     .. note:: The instructions in this chapter assume the user is implementing this scheme for use with the CCPP Single-Column model (:term:`SCM`); not only is the SCM more lightweight than a full 3D NWP model for development purposes, but using the SCM as a :term:`host model` is a requirement for all new CCPP schemes for testing purposes. For implementation in another host model, especially for adding new variables, some modifications to that host model's metadata may be required; see :numref:`Chapter %s <Host-side Coding>` for details

==============================
Criteria for inclusion in CCPP
==============================

CCPP governance, including interests from NOAA, NCAR, and developers of existing schemes, have decided on the following criteria for including new schemes in the CCPP physics repository.
Because there is some subjectivity in these items, and requirements may change over time, we encourage developers of prospective CCPP schemes to reach out via `Github discussions <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics/discussions>`_ at an early stage.

* The scheme must be sufficiently different from schemes already in the CCPP Physics repository.
* The scheme should be either

  * desired by an organization participating in the funding of CCPP or
  * the scheme’s development and/or testing is a funded project of a CCPP-sponsor organization.

* The scheme must be compiled/run with at least one CCPP-compliant host model, and pass that host model's regression tests.
* The scheme must be documented, ideally with references to published scientific results.
* The scheme must have developer support, or at least a point-of-contact for reviewing code changes.

==============================
Preparing a scheme for CCPP
==============================
There are a few steps that can be taken to prepare a scheme for addition to CCPP prior to starting the process of implementing it in the CCPP Framework:

1. Remove/refactor any incompatible features described in :numref:`Section %s <CodingRules>`. This includes updating Fortran code to at least Fortran 90 standards, removing ``STOP`` and ``GOTO`` statements, removing common blocks, and refactoring any other disallowed features.
2. Make an inventory of all variables that are inputs and/or outputs to the scheme. For the SCM, check the metadata information in ``CCPP_typedefs.meta`` and ``GFS_typedefs.meta``. For existing builds, query the *capgen* data table to get a list of all the required variable ``standard_names`` (see  :numref:`Chapter %s <ccpp_datafile>`. If there are variables that are not available, see :numref:`Section %s <Adding new variables to CCPP>`.

=============================
Implementing a scheme in CCPP
=============================

There are, broadly speaking, two approaches for connecting an existing physics scheme to the CCPP Framework:

1. Refactor the existing scheme to CCPP format standards, using ``pre_`` and ``post_`` :term:`interstitial schemes <interstitial scheme>` to interface to and from the existing scheme if necessary.
2. Create a driver scheme as an interface from the existing scheme's Fortran module to the CCPP Framework.

   *Diagram of the methods described in this section.*

Method 1 is the preferred method of adapting a scheme to CCPP. This involves making modifications to the original scheme so that it is CCPP-compliant (see :numref:`Chapter %s <CompliantPhysParams>`), containing subroutines that correspond to CCPP entry points (i.e. ``{schemename}_init``, ``{schemename}_run``, etc.) as necessary. It should be accompanied by appropriate metadata files (see :numref:`Section %s <MetadataRules>`), and it must be updated to remove any disallowed features as listed in :numref:`Section %s <CodingRules>`.

While method 1 is preferred, there are cases where method 1 may not be possible: for example, in schemes that are shared with other, non-CCPP hosts, and so require specialized, model-specific drivers, and might be beholden to different coding standards required by another model. In cases such as this, method 2 may be employed.

Method 2 involves fewer changes to the original scheme's Fortran module: A CCPP-compliant driver module (see :numref:`Chapter %s <CompliantPhysParams>`) handles defining the inputs to and outputs from the scheme module in terms of state variables, constants, and tendencies provided by the model as defined in the scheme's .meta file. The calculation of variables that are not available directly from the model, and conversion of scheme output back into the variables expected by CCPP, should be handled by interstitial schemes (``schemename_pre`` and ``schemename_post``). While this method puts most CCPP-required features in the driver and interstitial subroutines, the original scheme must still be updated to remove STOP statements, common blocks, or any other disallowed features as listed in :numref:`Section %s <CodingRules>`.

For both methods, optional interstitial schemes can be used for code that can not be handled within the scheme itself. For example, if different code needs to be run for coupling with other schemes or in different orders (e.g. because of dependencies on other schemes and/or the order the scheme is run in the :term:`SDF`), or if variables needed by the scheme must be derived from variables provided by the host. See  :numref:`Chapter %s <CompliantPhysParams>` for more details on primary and interstitial schemes.

     .. note:: Depending on the complexity of the scheme and how it works together with other schemes, multiple interstitial schemes may be necessary.

------------------------------
Adding new variables to CCPP
------------------------------

This section gives guidance on adding new variables to the CCPP, which is often necessary when adding a new scheme or adding capabilities to an existing one.

     .. note:: The instructions in this chapter assume the user is implementing this scheme for use in the CCPP Single-Column model (SCM). Other host model variables can be found in different files; see :numref:`Chapter %s <Host-side Coding>` for details

The first step is to be absolutely sure that a new variable is required: the desired variable may already be included in the CCPP for use by other schemes. For the SCM, check the metadata information in ``CCPP_typedefs.meta`` and ``GFS_typedefs.meta``. For existing builds, query the *capgen* data table to get a list of all the required variable ``standard_names`` (see  :numref:`Chapter %s <ccpp_datafile>` ).

If an input variable needed by the scheme is not available, first consider if it can be calculated from the existing CCPP variables. If so, an :term:`interstitial scheme` (such as ``schemename_pre``; see  :numref:`Chapter %s <CompliantPhysParams>` for more details) can be created to calculate the variable(s). If this path is taken, **there is no need to allocate this field in the host-model**, as  the variable will be allocated by the framework as a Suite Variable (see :numref:`Section %s <SuiteVariables>`)


     .. note:: The CCPP Framework is capable of performing automatic unit and type conversions between variables provided by the host model and variables required by the new scheme. See :numref:`Section %s <AutomaticVariableConversions>` for more details.

If an entirely new variable needs to be added, consult the CCPP standard names dictionary and the rules for creating new :term:`standard names <standard name>` at https://github.com/escomp/CCPPStandardNames. If in doubt, use the GitHub discussions page in the CCPP Framework repository (https://github.com/ncar/ccpp-framework) to discuss the suggested new standard name(s) with the CCPP developers.

     .. note:: It is important to keep in mind that not all SCM data types are persistent in memory. If the value of a variable must be remembered from one call to the next, it should not be in the interstitial or diagnostic data types. Most variables in the interstitial data type are reset (to zero or other initial values) at the beginning of a physics :term:`group` and do not persist from one :term:`set` to another or from one group to another. The diagnostic data type is periodically reset because it is used to accumulate variables for given time intervals. However, there is a small subset of interstitial variables that are set at creation time and are not reset; these are typically dimensions used in other interstitial variables.

For variables that can be set via namelist, the ``GFS_control_type`` Derived Data Type (DDT) should be used. In this case, it is also important to modify the namelist file to include the new variable.

If information from the previous timestep is needed, it is important to identify if the host model provides this information, or if it needs to be stored as a special variable. For example, in the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), variables containing the values of several quantities in the preceding timesteps are available. When that is not the case, as in the :term:`UFS Atmosphere`, interstitial schemes are needed to access these quantities.

     .. note:: As an example, the reader is referred to the `Grell-Freitas convective scheme <https://dtcenter.ucar.edu/GMTB/v7.0.0/sci_doc/_c_u__g_f.html>`_, which makes use of interstitials to obtain the previous timestep information.

Consider allocating the new variable only when needed (i.e. when the new scheme is used and/or when a certain control flag is set). If this is a viable option, following the existing examples in ``CCPP_typedefs.F90`` and ``GFS_typedefs.meta`` for allocating the variable and setting the ``active`` attribute in the metadata correctly.

----------------------------------
Incorporating a scheme into CCPP
----------------------------------
Any new scheme metadata, and any associated interstitial metadata files, will need to be provided to *capgen* for validation and cap generation (see :numref:`Chapter %s <CCPPCapgen>`)

.. code-block:: console

  # Scheme files  
  set(SCHEME_METADATA_FILES 
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiation/RRTMGP/rrtmgp_sw_main.meta"
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiation/RRTMGP/rrtmgp_lw_main.meta"
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiaiton/RRTMGP/new_scheme.meta")
  set(SCHEME_FORTRAN_FILES 
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiation/RRTMGP/rrtmgp_sw_main.F90"
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiation/RRTMGP/rrtmgp_lw_main.F90"
      "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ccpp/physics/Radiaiton/RRTMGP/new_scheme.F90")

*Listing 9.1: CMakelists.txt needed to include new scheme. In cases when not using CMake for the build-system, simply append the new metadata file to the file list prior to calling* ``ccpp_capgen.py``.

It is suggested that the source code and ``.meta`` files for the new scheme should be placed in the same directory, but this is not mandatory. The metadata file can be associated with a source file in another directory by setting the ``source_path`` attribute in the metadata file. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   [ccpp-arg-table]
     name = new_scheme
     type = scheme
     source_path = SOURCE_FILE_PATH

*Listing 9.2: CCPP metadata example where source file location is not the same as metadata file.*

*The* ``source_path`` *attribute can be useful when primary schemes reside in a submodule and the corresponding metadata file is elsewhere.*

To add this new scheme to a suite definition file (:term:`SDF`) for running within a :term:`host model`, follow the examples found in `ccpp-scm/ccpp/suites <https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-scm/tree/main/ccpp/suites>`__. For more information about suites and SDFs, see :numref:`Chapter %s <ConstructingSuite>`.

     .. note:: For the :term:`UFS Atmosphere`, suites can be found in the `ufs-weather-model/FV3/ccpp/suites <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/fv3atm/tree/develop/ccpp/suites>`__ directory

No further modifications of the build system are required, since the :term:`CCPP Framework` will auto-generate the necessary makefiles that allow the host model to compile the scheme.

------------------------------------
Time-split vs. process-split schemes
------------------------------------

It is a requirement that all CCPP primary schemes *provide tendencies for prognostic state variables. Modifying these state variables within the parameterization is not permitted. This requirement for the parameterizations allows the **host to control how the state evolves within the physics**. For example, in a process-split physics group, the tendencies can be accumulated and applied at the end of the group; a time-split physics group can update the state in-between calls to the parameterizations.

.. code-block:: xml

    <!-- Process Split Physics Group -->
    <group> process_split_phys
    <subcycle loop="1">
      <scheme>schemeA</scheme>
      <scheme>tendency_accumulate</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeB</scheme>
      <scheme>tendency_accumulate</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeC</scheme>
      <scheme>tendency_accumulate</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeD</scheme>
      <scheme>tendency_accumulate</scheme>
    </subcycle>

    <!-- Time Split Physics Group -->
    <group> time_split_phys
    <subcycle loop="2">
      <scheme>schemeE</scheme>
      <scheme>state_update</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeF</scheme>
      <scheme>state_update</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeG</scheme>
      <scheme>state_update</scheme>
      <scheme>schemeH</scheme>
      <scheme>state_update</scheme>
    </subcycle>

*Listing 9.3: Example suite definition file containing a process-split physics group and a time-split physics group. Within the groups, in between calls to the parameterizations, there are calls to interstitial schemes* ``tendency_accumulate`` *and* ``state_update``, *which either accumulate or update the state, respectively.*

Currently the UFS/SCM CCPP Physics contains a mix of process-split and time-split schemes, with the different strategies being handled by host-specific interstitial schemes. Future releases of CCPP will include a more robust system for handling these differences in the methods updating the atmospheric state.

.. _scheme-constituent-handling:

==================================
Constituent Handling in CCPP
==================================

The CCPP Framework (capgen) automatically handles the memory management for constituents/tracers. This section outlines declaration and usage of constituents and their properties within a physics scheme.

---------------------------------
Registering constituents in CCPP
---------------------------------

If a physics scheme requires a given constituent (or tracer), that constituent must be registered during that scheme's ``register`` phase. If multiple schemes are registering the same constituent and the metadata provided is identical, the framework will add it one time; otherwise, it will throw an error at runtime. The following code shows how to register constituents read in from a file (via both Fortran and metadata modifications):

.. code-block:: fortran

   subroutine physics_scheme_a(dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a, filename, errmsg, errflg)
     use ccpp_constituent_prop_mod, only: ccpp_constituent_properties_t

     type(ccpp_constituent_properties_t), allocatable, intent(out) :: dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a(:)
     character(len=256), intent(in) :: filename
     character(len=*), intent(out) :: errmsg
     integer, intent(out) :: errflg

     integer :: const_idx, ierr
     character(len=512), allocatable :: const_names(:)

     ! Read the file and determine what constituents are needed at runtime
     ! Allocate and populate const_names with those constituents

     ! Allocate the constituents properties array
     allocate(dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a(size(const_names)), stat=ierr)
     if (ierr /= 0) then
        errflag = 1
        errmsg = 'Failed to allocate "dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a"'
     end if

     ! Instantiate each constituent
     do const_idx = 1, size(const_names)
        ! Instantiate call may vary based on the properties of each runtime constituent
        call dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a(const_idx)%instantiate( &
                std_name = const_names(const_idx), &
                long_name = const_names(const_idx), &
                units = 'kg kg-1', &
                vertical_dim = 'vertical_layer_dimension', &
                min_value = 0.0_kind_phys, &
                advected = .true., &
                water_species = .true., &
                mixing_ratio_type = 'wet', &
                diag_name = const_names(const_idx), &
                errcode = errflg, &
                errmsg = errmsg)
        if (errflg /= 0) then
           return
        end if
     end do

   end subroutine physics_scheme_a

     type = scheme
   [ccpp-arg-table]
     name = physics_scheme_a_register

   [dynamic_const_phys_scheme_a]
     standard_name = dynamic_constituents_for_physics_scheme_a ! Standard name doesn't matter but must be unique
     units = none
     dimensions = (:)
     type = ccpp_constituent_properties_t ! This is what cues the framework that this is a constituent object

     intent = out

*Listing 9.5: CCPP metadata example for a register phase that instantiates run-time constituents*

.. note::
   All variables passed into and out of the register phase must be scalar variables.

---------------------------------
Using Constituents in CCPP
---------------------------------

Constituents are passed in to a scheme like any other variable. A scheme can request the full constituents array, the number of constituents, as well as the full properties object, like so:

.. code-block:: console

   [ccpp-arg-table]
     name = sample_scheme_run
     type = scheme
   [const_array]
     standard_name = ccpp_constituents
     units = none
     type = real | kind = kind_phys
     dimensions = (horizontal_dimension, vertical_layer_dimension, number_of_ccpp_constituents)
     intent = in
   [const_props]
     standard_name = ccpp_constituent_properties
     units = none
     type = ccpp_constituent_prop_ptr_t
     dimensions = (number_of_constituents)
     intent = in
   [nconst]
     standard_name = number_of_ccpp_constituents
     units = count
     type = integer
     dimensions = ()
     intent = in

*Listing 9.6: CCPP metadata example for passing around constituent object information.*

A single constituent can also be passed into a CCPP-compliant scheme using the metadata property ``constituent = True``, as in the below example:

.. code-block:: console

   [ccpp-arg-table]
     name = scheme_with_constituent_run
     type = scheme
   [water_vapor]
     standard_name = water_vapor_mixing_ratio_wrt_moist_air_and_condensed_water
     units = kg kg-1
     type = real | kind = kind_phys
     dimensions = (horizontal_dimension, vertical_layer_dimension)
     intent = in
     constituent = True

*Listing 9.7: CCPP metadata example for passing around a single constituent.*

Trying to access a constituent that has not been registered will result in a run-time error.

.. note::
   Neither specific constituents nor parts of the object can be passed into a scheme's register phase as the constituents object has not yet been initialized at that time.

---------------------------------
Constituent Indexes in CCPP
---------------------------------

The constituent array, tendency array, and object are all identically indexed. If you want to query the object for a given index, use the ``ccpp_constituent_index`` routine. For example, to get the index (returned in const_index) of water vapor:

.. code-block:: fortran

   use ccpp_scheme_utils, only: ccpp_constituent_index
   ...
   call ccpp_constituent_index('water_vapor_mixing_ratio_wrt_moist_air_and_condensed_water', const_index, errflg, errmsg)

*Listing 9.8: CCPP Fortran example of getting a constituent index from a given standard name.*

---------------------------------
Constituent Properties in CCPP
---------------------------------
If, as described in the section above, you have passed the ``ccpp_constituent_properties`` object into a scheme, you can access information about a given constituent. One use case for this would be if a scheme is iterating over the constituent array and only performing an operation if the tracer is advected. That example is below:

.. code-block:: fortran

   use ccpp_constituent_prop_mod, only: ccpp_constituent_prop_ptr_t
   ...
   type(ccpp_constituent_prop_ptr_t), intent(in) :: const_props(:)
   real(kind_phys), intent(in) :: const_array(:)
   integer, intent(in) :: nconst
   integer :: const_idx
   logical :: advected
   ...
   do const_idx = 1, nconst
      ! Determine if current constituent is advected
      call const_props(const_idx)%is_advected(advected)

      ! Use that to determine future action
      if (advected) then
         ! Do something
      end if
   end do

*Listing 9.9: CCPP Fortran example of using the constituent properties object.*

.. note::
   The best way to get access a property of a single constituent is to use the ``ccpp_constituent_index`` routine described in the section above.

The following are the important properties and an example of the interface to get that property from the object for the constituent at ``const_idx``.

* Standard name: ``call const_props(const_idx)%standard_name(standard_name, errflag, errmsg)``

* Diagnostic name: ``call const_props(const_idx)%diagnostic_name(diag_name, errflag, errmsg))``

* Units: ``call const_props(const_idx)%units(units, errflag, errmsg))``

* Advected: ``call const_props(const_idx)%advected(advected, errflag, errmsg))``

* Thermodynamically active: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_thermo_active(thermo_active, errflag, errmsg))``

* Water species: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_water_species(water_species, errflag, errmsg))``

* Mass mixing ratio: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_mass_mixing_ratio(mass_ratio, errflag, errmsg))``

* Volume mixing ratio: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_volume_mixing_ratio(vol_ratio, errflag, errmsg))``

* Number concentration: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_number_concentration(num_conc, errflag, errmsg))``

* Dry: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_dry(dry, errflag, errmsg))``

* Wet: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_wet(wet, errflag, errmsg))``

* Moist: ``call const_props(const_idx)%is_moist(moist, errflag, errmsg))``

* Minimum value: ``call const_props(const_idx)%minimum(min, errflag, errmsg))``

* Whether the constituent has a default value: ``call const_props(const_idx)%has_default(has_default, errflag, errmsg))``

* Default value: ``call const_props(const_idx)%default_value(default, errflag, errmsg))``

* Molar mass: ``call const_props(const_idx)%molar_mass(molar_mass, errflag, errmsg))``


---------------------------------
Constituent Tendencies in CCPP
---------------------------------

A tendency array is automatically allocated by the framework for the constituents that have been registered. This is used for time-split physics. As with the constituent state array, the tendencies can be accessed as a complete array with all constituent info:

.. code-block:: console

   [const_tend]
     standard_name = ccpp_constituent_tendencies
     units = none
     type = real | kind = kind_phys
     dimensions = (horizontal_dimension, vertical_layer_dimension, number_of_ccpp_constituents)
     intent = inout

*Listing 9.10: CCPP metadata example for passing around the complete constituent tendency array.*

OR a single constituent tendency can be passed around using the ``tendency_of`` keyword prepended to the standard_name for the constituent, along with the ``constituent = True`` property:

.. code-block:: console

   [water_vapor_tend]
     standard_name = tendency_of_water_vapor_mixing_ratio_wrt_moist_air_and_condensed_water
     units = kg kg-1
     type = real | kind = kind_phys
     dimensions = (horizontal_dimension, vertical_layer_dimension)
     intent = in
     constituent = True

*Listing 9.11: CCPP metadata example for passing around an individual constituent tendency array.*

==================================
Testing and debugging a new scheme
==================================

Before running this new scheme, check for consistency between the namelist and the :term:`SDF`. There is no default consistency check between the SDF and the namelist unless the developer adds one. Errors such as segmentation faults may occur if this consistency is not upheld, due to appropriate arrays not being allocated.

To test a new scheme that has been added to the :term:`SCM`, compile the SCM with a suite definition file that contains the newly added scheme.

Some tips for debugging problems:

* Segmentation faults are often related to variables and array allocations.
* As mentioned above, make sure the SDF and namelist are compatible. Inconsistencies may result in segmentation faults because arrays are not allocated or in unintended scheme(s) being executed.
* Make sure to use an uppercase suffix ``.F90`` to enable C preprocessing.
* A scheme called GFS_debug (GFS_debug.F90) may be added to the SDF where needed to print state variables and interstitial variables. If needed, edit the scheme beforehand to add new variables that need to be printed.
* Check the ``ccpp_validator.py`` script for success/failure and associated messages.
* Check the ``ccpp_capgen.py`` script for success/failure and associated messages.
* Compile code in DEBUG mode (see section 4.3 of the `SCM User's Guide <https://ccpp-scm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chap_quick.html#compiling-scm-with-ccpp>`_, run through debugger if necessary (gdb, Linaro/Arm DDT, totalview, …).
* Use memory check utilities such as ``valgrind``.
* Double-check the metadata file associated with your scheme to make sure that all information, including standard names and units, correspond to the correct local variables.
